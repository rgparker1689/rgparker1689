# About Me
I am a rising junior at the University of Alabama pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science to be completed by May of 2023. I am also a part of UA's STEM to MBA track as well as the Accelerated Masters Program (for M.C.S). My interests include data science/engineering and machine learning, especially as they relate to previously unnoticed trends in audio-related time-series and beyond. 

## What I'm Working On

 1. I am currently working with UA's [EcoCAR](https://avtcseries.org/ecocar-mobility-challenge/) team as a member of the HMI/UX and Machine Learning subteams.
 2. On a personal note, I am working on a number of projects centered around classifying and breaking down supplied .wav files containing drum grooves. My progress can be found in my groove-ml repo. I am currently working with Python (Librosa, Keras, etc.) but have also been learning other languages such as R.
