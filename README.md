# About Me
I am a rising junior at the University of Alabama pursuing a bachelor's degree with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics (w/ a concentration in Statistics & Optimization). I am also a part of UA's Accelerated Masters Program (for M.C.S) to be completed by December of 2023. My interests include data science/engineering and machine learning, especially as they relate to previously unnoticed trends in audio-related time-series and beyond. 

## What I'm Working On

 1. I am currently working with UA's [EcoCAR](https://avtcseries.org/ecocar-mobility-challenge/) Machine Learning subteam.
 2. I am doing undergraduate research at UA in human activity and gesture recognition with radar.
 3. On a personal note, I am working on a number of projects centered around classifying and breaking down supplied .wav files containing drum grooves. My progress can be found in my groove-ml repo. I am currently working with Python (Librosa, Keras, etc.) but have also been learning other languages such as R.
